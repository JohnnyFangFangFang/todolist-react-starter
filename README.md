# üè¨Introduction
This is a React practice from Alpha Camp in semester 3 (frontend).  
It is one of the homeworks from React-related courses, so I keep practicing through time while upscaling my skills in JSX, components, Sass, etc.

The image below shows what it looks like.  
![20230519 todolist-react](https://github.com/JohnnyFangFangFang/todolist-react-starter/assets/121143837/433ee8d1-cd3c-4f0d-9ee3-bf7f779d9493)  

# Features
* Just those features appearing in a typical todo list would be anticipated here. It's a practice.  

# Prerequisites
* Node.js 14.16.0
* React 18.2.0  

# Installation and Execution
1. Please ensure that Node.js and npm are well installed in your local environment.
2. Find a folder where you want to put this project, open Terminal, and run the command for cloning:
```
git clone https://github.com/JohnnyFangFangFang/todolist-react-starter.git
```
3. Then, you'll see a directory called "todolist-react-starter". Enter the directory and run the command (would take a while, be patient):
```
npm install
```
4. After installment, run:
```
npm start
```
5. The project is ran successfully while seeing the following info in Terminal:
```
webpack compiled successfully
```
6. Usually, your browser will run automatically and show the project. If it doesn't, please open your browser, type "http://localhost:3000", then enjoy the project. BTW, that would be entertaining if you could enjoy watching this React practice, lol. If you did so, please let me know.
7. Press "ctrl + c" in Terminal if you want to stop running the project. (PAT test5)
